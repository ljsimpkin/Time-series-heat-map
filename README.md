# Time-series-heat-map
A dynamic way to play with datasets

Try it yourself using data from places i've traveled [here](https://ljsimpkin.github.io/Time-series-heat-map/)

Raw CSV data is cleaned using dataBaker.py and converted into JSON. Using Google Map's API, heatmaps and interactive widgets are generated.
